I try to attend frequent quizzes to come across,learn and test new concepts/topics/ideas; thought why not share it with others.Maybe host more quizzes later on.
Do not hold the copyright of the resources/books/articles/online sources which talk about the ideas/concepts etc the tests span across,do not claim to - but then nobody can ask a question without using ideas 
from formal work right!

If you have an edge
- make use of it to have more
- Spoil the party by making it public to even up the field

**Bots stay away**

Test yourself or have fun when bored!
